## **Multiplayer**

Another Recursion is an exclusively online multiplayer game, requiring players to be in gaming lobbies.

To do this, simply enter any name or pseudonym in the “Team Color” bar, or enter a specific color code.
if desired.


To create a room, press the “Create” button, you will obtain a code.
This code must be given to your opponent, who will enter it in the “Lobby Code” bar, then press the Join button.
